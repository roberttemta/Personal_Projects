SOC 2 Type 2 is a cybersecurity compliance framework that assesses an organization's 
 data security controls over a set period of time. 
It's part of the System and Organization Controls (SOC) suite of services, developed by the American Institute of 
Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) in 2010. 
The framework's goal is to ensure that third-party service providers securely store and process customer data, and to 
    help organizations reduce the risk of security breaches. 
SOC 2 Type 2 assessments are based on five Trust Services Criteria (TSC) pillars: 
   -security, 
   -privacy, 
   -availability, 
   -confidentiality, 
   -and processing integrity. 
Service organizations can choose which categories are relevant to them and their services. 
An independent audit firm then evaluates the organization's controls to see how well they've been designed. 
The results are reported in a SOC 2 Type 2 Report, which can take several months to complete. 
The report can help organizations demonstrate their security controls, answer security questionnaires, 
and win more sales deals.
